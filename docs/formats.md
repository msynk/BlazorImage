# Formats and capabilities

## What decodes and encodes where

| Format | Managed decode | Managed encode | Browser decode | Browser encode |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| PNG | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| JPEG | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| BMP | yes | yes | yes | via managed |
| GIF | first frame | no | first frame | no |
| WebP | no | no | yes | usually |
| AVIF | no | no | usually | rarely |
| SVG | refused | no | refused | no |

"Managed" means pure C#, working anywhere including a server. "Browser" means the platform's own codecs, which is the
only way to reach WebP and AVIF in a browser.

When both are available the browser codec wins, because it is hardware accelerated and covers more formats. The managed
codecs remain the fallback, which is what makes prerendering and server-side use work.

## Never assume, always probe

Format support varies by browser, version and platform, and browsers lie in a specific way: asked to encode a format
they cannot write, they silently produce a PNG instead. BlazorImage probes by actually encoding a pixel and checking
what came back.

```csharp
var capabilities = await capabilityProvider.GetAsync();

if (capabilities.CanEncode(ImageFormat.Avif)) { /* ... */ }
if (capabilities.SupportsWebP) { /* ... */ }
```

The substitution is detected rather than passed on:

```csharp
try
{
    var avif = await exporter.EncodeAsync(image, ImageExportOptions.Avif);
}
catch (ImageCapabilityException ex)
{
    // "This browser cannot encode Avif; it produced image/png instead. Check
    //  ImageCapabilities.CanEncode before exporting and fall back to a supported format."
}
```

If you would rather degrade than handle an exception, ask for a preference order:

```csharp
var encoded = await exporter.EncodeWithFallbackAsync(
    image,
    [ImageFormat.Avif, ImageFormat.WebP, ImageFormat.Jpeg],
    new ImageExportOptions { Quality = 0.82 });

Console.WriteLine(encoded.Format);   // whichever one this browser can actually write
```

## What else capability detection reports

```csharp
var c = await capabilityProvider.GetAsync();

c.Environment                  // BrowserWebAssembly, BrowserServer, Server or Prerendering
c.DecodableFormats             // probed with real 1x1 images
c.EncodableFormats             // probed by really encoding
c.SupportsOffscreenCanvas
c.SupportsWebWorkers
c.SupportsImageBitmap
c.SupportsWebCodecs
c.SupportsClipboardRead / SupportsClipboardWrite
c.SupportsFileSystemAccess
c.SupportsCamera
c.SupportsWasmSimd / SupportsWasmThreads
c.DevicePixelRatio
c.HardwareConcurrency          // null when the browser does not say
c.DeviceMemoryGb               // null when the browser does not say
c.MaxCanvasDimension           // found by allocating until the browser refuses
c.SuggestedMaxWorkingDimension // a sensible interactive cap for this device
```

`MaxCanvasDimension` is worth taking seriously. Browsers do not expose their canvas limit, and exceeding it produces a
silently blank canvas rather than an error, which is far worse than a refusal. The probe allocates progressively smaller
canvases and writes a pixel to each until one reads back correctly. Chrome on a desktop typically reports 32767; Safari
on an older iPhone can be 4096.

```csharp
if (!capabilities.CanRenderCanvas(width, height))
{
    // Work at SuggestedMaxWorkingDimension instead of producing a blank image.
}
```

Detection is cached for the lifetime of the provider, because it cannot change without a page reload. It costs a few
milliseconds and runs once.

## Choosing a format

| Situation | Choose |
| --- | --- |
| Photographs, broad compatibility | JPEG at 0.8 to 0.85 |
| Photographs, modern browsers | WebP at 0.8, roughly 25 to 35% smaller than JPEG at similar quality |
| Anything needing transparency | WebP, or PNG for lossless |
| Screenshots, diagrams, flat colour | PNG |
| Smallest possible, where supported | AVIF, but always with a fallback |
| Clipboard | PNG; most browsers accept nothing else |

Circular avatars need transparency, so prefer WebP or PNG there; a lossy opaque format will show the corners.

## Quality and size budgets

```csharp
var encoded = await exporter.EncodeAsync(image, new ImageExportOptions
{
    Format      = ImageFormat.WebP,
    Quality     = 0.9,
    MaxFileSize = 100 * 1024,
    MinQuality  = 0.5,
    MaxFileSizeStrategy = MaxFileSizeStrategy.QualityThenDimensions,
});

Console.WriteLine($"{encoded.Length} bytes at quality {encoded.Quality}");
```

`MaxFileSize` bisects on quality first, down to `MinQuality`, then shrinks dimensions if the strategy allows it. The
quality actually used is reported on the result, so you can show it. When the target is impossible you get an
`ImageEncodeException` explaining what the smallest attempt produced, rather than a silently oversized file.

| Strategy | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `QualityThenDimensions` | Lower quality first, then shrink. The default. |
| `QualityOnly` | Never change dimensions; throw if the budget cannot be met. |
| `DimensionsOnly` | Keep quality fixed and shrink. |

## Transparency and formats without alpha

JPEG has no alpha channel. Exporting a transparent image as JPEG composites it over `ImageExportOptions.Background`,
which defaults to white. Set it explicitly if white is wrong for your page:

```csharp
new ImageExportOptions { Format = ImageFormat.Jpeg, Background = new Rgba32(18, 18, 20) }
```

Without this, browsers composite over black, which is rarely what anyone wants.

## Format detection

Content is trusted over file names and content types, because both can be wrong or hostile:

```csharp
var format = ImageFormats.Detect(bytes);              // magic bytes
var byName = ImageFormats.FromFileName("photo.JPG");  // convenience only
var byMime = ImageFormats.FromMimeType("image/webp"); // convenience only
```

`ImageProcessor.Identify` reads dimensions from the header without decoding pixels, which is how you can reject an
oversized upload before allocating anything:

```csharp
var info = processor.Identify(bytes);
if (info is null) return Error("Not a supported image.");
if ((long)info.Width * info.Height > 40_000_000) return Error("Too large.");
Console.WriteLine($"{info.Width}×{info.Height} {info.Format}, displays as {info.DisplaySize}");
```

`DisplaySize` accounts for EXIF orientation, so a portrait photo from a phone reports portrait dimensions even though
the stored pixels are landscape.

## GIF and SVG

GIF decodes its first frame, with palettes, interlacing and transparency. Animation is out of scope. GIF encoding is not
supported by any browser canvas and is not implemented here; use WebP or PNG.

SVG is refused with an explanatory error rather than rasterised. Rendering untrusted SVG can execute embedded scripts and
fetch remote resources, and a library cannot make that safe on the caller's behalf. If you control the SVG, rasterise it
yourself and pass the pixels.
