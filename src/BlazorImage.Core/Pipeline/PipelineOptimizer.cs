/// resize output and only writes the surviving region, so the pixels match exactly.</item>
/// <item><b>More accurate, not identical.</b> Fusing per-pixel operations removes the intermediate 8-bit quantisation
/// that separately executed adjustments perform between steps. Values are still clamped to [0,1] between fused stages,
/// matching CSS filter chain semantics, so clipping behaviour is unchanged; only rounding differs, typically by a
/// couple of units per channel over a long chain.</item>
/// <item><b>Higher quality, visibly different.</b> Dropping a resize whose result is entirely replaced by a following
/// resize removes an intermediate resample. The framing is unchanged but the surviving resample runs from the original
/// pixels instead of already-downscaled ones, so the result is sharper and can differ from the unoptimised output by
/// tens of units per channel on detailed images. This is the intended benefit of the rule; set

/// <item>Drop a resize immediately followed by another resize when the first one's result is entirely replaced, i.e.
